# Models Documentation

This document provides essential information about generative AI models to help you understand their sources, selection criteria, creators, and classifications.

---

## 1. Where Can I Find the Models?
Models can be sourced from the following repositories and platforms:
- **Hugging Face Model Hub**: A repository of open-source models across various domains.
- **OpenAI API**: For GPT-based models and more.
- **Cohere**: Specializing in text generation and embedding models.
- **EleutherAI**: Open-source alternatives to proprietary language models.
- **Google AI Model Garden**: Models for advanced use cases like T5 and BERT.
- **Meta AI**: Open LLaMA models and other resources.
- **Custom Training Pipelines**: For creating domain-specific models.

## 2. Which Model to Select for My Use Case?
### Factors to Consider:
- **Task Type**: Choose based on classification, generation, summarization, or embedding tasks.
- **Domain-Specific Needs**: Opt for fine-tuned models tailored for specific industries.
- **Size vs. Speed**: Larger models perform better but may have slower inference times.
- **Privacy and Licensing**: Evaluate the permissiveness of open-source licenses or opt for custom solutions for sensitive data.
- **Community Support**: Prefer models with active communities and robust documentation.

## 3. Where Are Models Downloaded?
Models are typically downloaded and stored locally or in cloud storage, based on the tool or library:
- **Transformers Library**: `$HOME/.cache/huggingface/transformers/`
- **PyTorch Hub**: Local `~/.torch/` cache.
- **Custom Directory**: Specify paths using configuration files in deployment tools.
- **Docker Images**: Containerized model deployments store models in `/models`.

## 4. Who Creates These Models?
### Major Contributors:
- **Research Labs**: OpenAI, DeepMind, Google AI, Meta AI, Microsoft Research.
- **Open-Source Communities**: Hugging Face, EleutherAI, Cohere.
- **Academia**: Universities and research organizations collaborating on cutting-edge AI.
- **Individual Developers**: Open-source enthusiasts who share their contributions via platforms like GitHub.

## 5. Classification of All the Models Out There
### Categories of Models:
1. **Generative Models**: GPT, LLaMA, T5.
2. **Classification Models**: BERT, RoBERTa.
3. **Embedding Models**: Sentence Transformers, Cohere Embed.
4. **Vision Models**: DALLÂ·E, Stable Diffusion.
5. **Audio Models**: Whisper, Wav2Vec.
6. **Multi-Modal Models**: CLIP, Flamingo.

### Additional Classifications:
- **Pre-trained vs. Fine-tuned Models**: Distinguish between generic pre-trained models and specialized fine-tuned variants.
- **Open-Source vs. Proprietary**: Models with open licensing versus those requiring paid access.
